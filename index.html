          <h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
          <p>The future of AI lies in enabling people to collaborate with machines to solve complex problems. Like any efficient collaboration, this requires good communication, trust, clarity and understanding. XAI (eXplainable AI) aims at addressing such challenges by combining the best of symbolic AI and traditional Machine Learning. Such topic has been studied for years by all different communities of AI, with different definitions, evaluation metrics, motivations and results.</p>

          <p>This tutorial is a snapshot on the work of XAI to date, and surveys the work achieved by the AI community with a focus on machine learning and symbolic AI related approaches (given the half-day format). We will motivate the needs of XAI in real-world and large-scale applications, while presenting state-of-the-art techniques, with best XAI coding and engineering practices. In the first part of the tutorial, we give an introduction to the different aspects of explanations in AI. We then focus the tutorial on two specific approaches: (i) XAI using machine learning and (ii) XAI using a combination of graph-based knowledge representation and machine learning. For both we get into the specifics of the approach, the state of the art and the research challenges for the next steps. The final part of the tutorial gives an overview of real-world ap-plications of XAI as well as best XAI coding and engineering practices, as XAI technologies are required to be seamlessly integrated in AI applications.</p>

        <h4>Part I: Introduction, Motivation & Evaluation - 20 minutes</h4>
        <p>Broad-spectrum introduction on explanation in AI. This will include describing and motivating the need for explainable AI techniques, from both theoretical and applicative standpoints. In this part we also summarize the prerequisites, and we introduce the different angles taken by the rest of the tutorial.</p>

        <h4>Part II: Explanation in AI (not only Machine Learning!) - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p>General overview of explanation in various field of AI (optimization, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, search and constraint optimization, planning, natural language processing, robotics and vision) to align everyone on the various definitions of explanation. Evaluation of explainability will be also covered. The tutorial will cover most of definitions but will only go deep in the following areas: (i) Explainable Machine Learning, (ii) Explainable AI with Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning.</p>

        <h4>Part III: Explanation for Deep Neural Networks - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p> In this section of the tutorial we address the challenge of explaining deep neural networks: from models consuming image, text and time series. </p>

        <h4>Part IV: On The Role of Knowledge Graphs in Explainable Machine Learning - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p> In this section of the tutorial we address the explanatory power of combining graph-based knowledge bases with machine learning approaches. </p>

        <h4>Part V: XAI Applications and Lessons Learnt - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p>We will review some XAI open source and commercial tools applied in real-world examples. We describe how XAI could be instantiated based on the technical and business challenge. In particular we focus on a number of use cases: (1) explaining object detection, (2) explaining obstacle detection for autonomous trains, (3) explaining flight performance, (4) an interpretable flight delay prediction system, with built-in explanation capabilities, (5) a wide-scale contract management system that predicts and explains the risk tier of corporate projects with semantic reasoning over knowledge graphs, (6) an expenses system that identifies, explains, and predict abnormal expense claims by employees of large organizations in 500+ cities, (7) an explanation system for credit decisions, (8) an explanation system for medical conditions, as well as 8 other use cases in industry.</p>

        <h4>Part VI: XAI Tools, Coding & Engineering Practices Conclusion, and Research Challenges - 40 minutes</h4>
        <p>We go through XAI coding & engineering practices by demonstrating how XAI could be integrated, and tested. This section will go through development codes, which are shared with Google Colab for easy interaction with the AAAI audience. A Google account (to access Google Colab) is required for this section.</p>
